Scratch Portfolio Website

As part of my web design course, I was coding a personal portfolio site from scratch.
I realized I was able to create a better design by focusing on the design itself and not as much on the development.

I am currently customizing and designing a WordPress site for my portfolio.
Once this site is live, the domain will be shelbyoyer.com.

In the meantime, I created a WordPress site that will serve my needs.
This site can be seen at shelbyoyer.wordpress.com.
Files and edits to this site are located in my wp-portfolio repository.
